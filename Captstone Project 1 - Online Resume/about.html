    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Now that I'm twenty-two years old, free time doesn't come nearly as free as it use to; much of the time that used to be devoted to doing stupid things with friends is now devoted to furthering my skills and working as a web developer for the College of Eastern Idaho. What free time I do have, however, largely consists of writing code for personal projects, reading up on history, taking strolls around beautiful Idaho Falls, Idaho, and playing games with friends - whether that be video games with buddies online or Dungeons & Dragons with work colleagues. I also play tennis from time to time, and have recently taken up pickleball (I promise it's more enjoyable than you'd think).</p>
    <p>I like to think I'm an optimistic and open-minded person; I'm a big fan of exploring new potential areas of interest and am always down to give other people's favorite pastimes a chance. As previously mentioned, many of my hobbies have their own dedicated page you can visit, so if you are interested in what I have made or said in regards to any of those topics, please do check out the links in the navbar above. If you have professional inquiries or just simply want to chat, you can get in touch with me you using the contact page. For a condensed summary of my academic experience, work history, and skill set, you can view my resume or check out my Linkedin page found using the icon below.</p>
    <p>Good luck out there!</p>
    <p>- Benjamin</p>
